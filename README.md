In this lab, we will launch the flashcard app. First, click on add flashcard and enter the lab name, my name, and z number, then we click save. Next, weâ€™ll go through the questions, swiping right for correct answers and left for incorrect ones. Once we've reviewed all the cards, we then can click on more practice to revisit the cards we swiped left on. After reviewing, we can click reset to go through the questions again.
